#ShoeStalker

##Description

This is a course assignment for Computational Robotics, taught at Olin College in Fall 2014. The learning goal of the project was to use computer vision to control a robot. Our team decided to write a program in Python on the ROS (Robot Operating System) that follows people based on their shoes' color and features.

##Main File
